            Ben and Elizabeth met at Parkside church and fell in love. Ben asked Elizabeth to marry her one fall evening
            on
            their one year anniversary after a walk in the park. Elizabeth never saw it coming and she squealed in
            excitement
            and gave a resounding yes as Ben asked her to spend the rest of their lives together. Emerging from a cave
            were
            excited friends who got to share in such a special moment with them before they went off to dinner. After
            the
            wedding they plan on moving in to their new house in Middlefield where they will start the next chapter of
            their
            lives as husband and wife.
