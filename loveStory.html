        Ben and Elizabeth met at Parkside church and fell in love. Ben asked Elizabeth to marry her one fall evening on
        their one year anniversary after a walk in the park. Elizabeth never saw it coming and she squealed in
        excitement
        and gave a resounding yes as Ben asked her to spend the rest of their lives together. Emerging from a cave were
        excited friends who got to share in such a special moment with them before they went off to dinner. After the
        wedding they plan on moving in to their new house in Middlefield where they will start the next chapter of their
        lives as husband and wife.
